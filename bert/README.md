For this homework you will have to finish the implementation of a BERT model and train it on a dataet of rotten tomatoes reviews. The dataset is fairly large(500k) 
so I prepared a subset that is 10% of the train and test datasets. Train on the mini dataset and we will be able to compare accuracy. 

*mmlu_dataset.ipynb* contains the demonstration of how to use tiny benchmarks on a subset from MMLU to evaluate two LLMs.

*assignment_bert.ipynb* contans all the information necessary to complete the assignment for next week.


To download the full dataset use the following commands (For Linux or MacOS):
!wget https://github.com/iust-deep-learning/982/raw/master/static_files/assignments/asg04_assets/reviews.zip
!unzip reviews.zip
If you are using Windows download the dataset using your preferred browser:
